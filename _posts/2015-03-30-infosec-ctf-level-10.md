# ctf.infosecinstitute.com: Level 10
**Bounty:** $100
**Description:**

> What kind of sound is this? Sorcery perhaps?? ["listen"]({{site.url}}/assets/Flag.wav)

## Write-up

To solve this one I used Audacity a software for recording and editing sounds. Adjust the Playback speed to 0.13x and play it. You can hear the message for the flag.
