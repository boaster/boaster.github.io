Very interesting and fun challenge, it's build on the concept of a [shadow stack](https://blogs.intel.com/evangelists/2016/06/09/intel-release-new-technology-specifications-protect-rop-attacks/).

## Main

A quick look at the functionality, we see it's pretty simple.

{% highlight text %}
âžœ  shadow ./shadow
Hello!
You can send message three times.
Input name : AAAA
Message length : 10
Input message : BBBBB
(1/3) <AAAA> BBBBB

Change name? (y/n) :
{% endhighlight %}

We get to input a name and a message 3 times. Let's see what we can find underneath the hood :)

This is weird, right ? We are in `main` but there's a function `call` that calls `_main` ? Well whatever, let's first see how `_main` looks like. Maybe we can just find the vulnerability there and move on.

## _Main

![_main]({{site.url}}/assets/Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 1.43.36 AM.png)

Looks like `_main` doesn't have much going on either. It prints the welcome message via `printf` and calls `message`. So, let's go see the `message` function.

## Message

{% highlight C %}
int message(char* name, int name_length, int counter_limit) {
    canary = *0x14;
    for (counter = 0x0; counter < counter_limit; counter = counter + 0x1) {

            char input_buffer[0x20];
            memset(input_buffer, 0, 0x20);

            if (call(strlen(name)) != 0x0) {
                    call(printf("Change name? (y/n) : "));
                    call(getnline(input_buffer, 0x20));
            }
            if ((call(strlen(name)) == 0x0) || ((input_buffer & 0xff) == 'y')) {
                    call(printf("Input name : "));
                    call(getnline(name, name_length));
            }

            call(printf("Message length : "));
            call(getnline(input_buffer));
            int msg_len = call(atoi(input_buffer)); // atoi returns signed int

            // Signed check
            if (msg_len > 0x20) {
                    msg_len = 0x20;
            }
            call(printf("Input message : "));
            call(getnline(input_buffer, msg_len));
            call(printf("(%d/%d) <%s> %s\\n\\n", counter, counter_limit, name, input_buffer));
    }

    eax = ret(0x0);
    esi = canary ^ *0x14;
    COND = esi == 0x0;
    if (!COND) {
            eax = __stack_chk_fail();
    }
    return eax;
}

{% endhighlight %}

So, this is where everything is happening... We get to loop 3 times and input 3 messages with control of the length of the message and optionally change the name. If you haven't spot the vulnerability by now, it's the signed check for `msg_len > 0x20`. We can supply negative length here and overflow the whole stack frame with anything we want. Because we get to do this 3 times we can easily overwrite the null-byte of the canary on the first loop. This will cause `printf` at the end of the loop to leak the canary. On the second loop we can restore the canary and overwrite the saved return pointer and we even get 1 loop to spare, easy 400 pts.

Yes, but not really... You see the call `eax = ret(0x0)` before the end of the function ? This is where the original saved return address will be restored from the `"shadow stack"` and our return pointer will be overwritten. To see how this works, let's reverse the `call` function.

## Call, Push, Ret, mprotect ?

From the previous functions we saw that `call` gets called with the first argument a potential function to be executed followed by the typical arguments of that function and the assembly shows us just that. So the `push` function is called twice with arguments the saved return pointer and saved base pointer of `call`. Next, the function pointer is loaded in EAX to be jumped to as we can see in the last instruction. But whats that `ret_stub` before that ? And what seems to be, it's replacing the function pointer from arg 0 ? Yes, but no :P, the `LEAVE` instruction will basically do `MOV ESP, EBP ; POP EBP` which will restore the stack frame, meaning ESP will point to the return pointer. BUT... there's `add esp, 4` after the `leave`, this is where ESP will no longer point to the saved return pointer but it will point to the first argument which is now a pointer to the `ret_stub` function.

The `push` function is also very interesting... Here we see the `stack_buf` global variable as a pointer to the `shadow stack`. First the memory's permissions are changed to `rw` then the argument (which if you remember from the `call` function is always saved return pointer and saved base pointer) is processed through the `enc_dec` function which just XORs it with a futex stored at `gs:0x18` and then moved to the `shadow stack`. After that the memory's permissions are changed back to 0.

![push]({{site.url}}/assets/Screen Shot 2016-09-05 at 2.54.49 AM.png)

The `ret` function is absolutely the same as the `push` function, it just instead of storing data it pops data from the `shadow stack` restores the saved ebp and jumps to the poped saved return pointer.

Pretty cool implementation right ? So how are we going to pwn it ?

## Exploit

Before jumping directly to the exploit, let's first see what we can control. We leaked the canary, a saved base pointer providing us with relative offsets to anything on the stack, we control the counter for the for loop and the counter_limit, we also control the `name*`, `name_length` and `msg_len` for `getnline` function. So this means we can write anywhere anything.

I didn't show u the function pointers passed to `call` but they are basically pointers from the GOT with FULL RELRO, so GOT overwrite is not an option. However, if we think for a second, the saved return pointer is replaced with the `ret` function BEFORE we jump to a function in libc. And when the libc function we called to returns it will pop this value from the stack ! So what if we pre-calculate the address of the saved return pointer for `read` from `getnline` ? This means read will be overwriting it's own saved return address and returning to whatever address we place there. 

Here is the full exploit code
